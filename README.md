# Formal a Type Inferencer for System F

This is my implementation of the project *type inferencer*.
All code for basic parts are in folder lean, file *lang_def.lean*, and you can search for all exercises with ctrl f + exercise + exercise number.
All code for system F are in folder lean, file *poly.lean*.
*Exercises 5* for the basic part is written as comment with codes and also written in the report.

Based on that, the third extension, polymorphism with System F is implemented in folder lean, *poly.lean*.
